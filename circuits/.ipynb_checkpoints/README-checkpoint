Depends on QuantumOps R package
QFT/QAOA require the gridsynth binary (https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/newsynth/) to be located in top folder 


Run experiment with

Rscript launch.R <argument>

Where the arguments (in order) are
problem                   which circuit should be performed     (idle,random,qft,qftDecomposed,qaoa,qaoaDecomposed)
graph                     qubit count or qaoa problem           (any integer or 'Xanadu' (4 qubit graph) or '3reg' (8 qubit graph))
Error                     type of error to insert               ('AD','pauli','bothx','coherent')
error                     maximum error to apply                (0.1 to go from 0-0.1)
e_mode                    noise insertion mode                  (0=none,1=by Gate,2=by Cycle,3=byQubit,4=on every gate)
tidx                      index of noise                        (100 to set to full value of "error", linearly scaled down to zero)
depth                     depth of circuit for idle/random      (any integer)
RC                        (boolean to randomize compile)        (0=no,1=yes)
extraCycles               (boolean to insert extra cycles)      (0=no,1=yes)
state                     (input state to simulation)           (zero,random)
samples                   number of sample to repeat simulation (any integer)
